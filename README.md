# SQL_Projects

A compilation of ever-growing SQL projects using open-source and proprietary datasets to showcase mastery of SQL. To know more about a particular project (eg., project's level, source of original dataset), go to README.md file.



Projects range from:

  * **Beginner** -  *installing SQL in Juptyer, loading datafile, statements (e.g., SELECT, FROM), manipulating & analyzing columns, calculating summary statistics(eg., MIN, MAX, AVG), operators (e.g., ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= ), clauses (e.g., WHERE, ORDER BY), functions(e.g., CAST)*



* **Intermediate** - *subqueries, joins (e.g., INNER, LEFT, OUTER),*

All projects include annotations to help guide users through projects. Feel free to reach out to me and =)
